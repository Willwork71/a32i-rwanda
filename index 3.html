  <h1>Saint Kitts and Nevis: Economic Value Brief (2024–2025)</h1>

  <h2>Government Readiness & AI Onboarding</h2>
  <p>
    Saint Kitts and Nevis has positioned itself as a forward-thinking Caribbean nation by embracing artificial intelligence as a tool for public sector transformation. 
    Prime Minister Dr. Terrance Drew has publicly emphasized the government’s intent to integrate AI in areas such as traffic management and public safety, noting that 
    “the integration of AI will enable us to monitor traffic patterns in real-time, thereby improving response times and reducing congestion.” 
    The country is also pioneering legal tech by deploying an AI-powered assistant to help citizens access legal information—becoming the first nation in the region to do so. 
    In December 2024, it further highlighted its AI-driven justice reform model at a UNDP-EU global forum. 
    With leadership openly committed to AI, and pilot programs already underway across governance, law, and citizen services, 
    Saint Kitts and Nevis is emerging as a testbed for innovative, small-nation AI integration.
