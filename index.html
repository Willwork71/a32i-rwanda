    <h1>Rwanda: Economic Value Brief (2024–2025)</h1>

    <h2>Government Readiness & AI Vision</h2>
    <p>
        Rwanda has emerged as one of Africa’s most proactive nations in preparing for AI integration, guided by its National AI Policy and a clear vision from top leadership. 
        Minister of ICT and Innovation Paula Ingabire stated, 
        <em>“Strategic deployment of AI across agriculture, governance, and infrastructure will accelerate Rwanda’s development goals.”</em> 
        The government is developing over 50 AI tools across key sectors and investing heavily in digital education programs like 1 Million Coders to build a future-ready workforce. 
        With strong public infrastructure, responsible AI policy, and a sustainability agenda that leverages AI for climate resilience, Rwanda is laying the groundwork for transformative, tech-driven growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Projected Economic Value from A32i Integration</h2>
    <p>
        By integrating A32i’s AI-powered platforms across its economy, food systems, and social services at just 30%, Rwanda stands to generate an estimated 
        <strong>$480–$675 million in annual value</strong>, boosting GDP by up to 4.9%. 
        Through better policy alignment, smarter agriculture, and targeted social solutions, the country can achieve long-term sustainability, investment attraction, and improved quality of life — all within a 36-month window.
